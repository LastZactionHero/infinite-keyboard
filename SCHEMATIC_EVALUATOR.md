Okay, I understand. Let's focus specifically on creating a thorough checklist for evaluating the **schematic** first. The goal is to build confidence in the design's electrical correctness based purely on the connections and component choices shown in the schematic, incorporating validation against datasheets.

Here is a list of key areas and specific checks crucial for evaluating a PCB schematic. If a schematic passes these checks (ideally verified against datasheets where applicable), you can be reasonably confident in its functional design before moving to the physical layout:

**Schematic Evaluation Checklist:**

1.  **Basic Connectivity & Electrical Rules:**
    * Are all component pins intended to be connected actually connected to a net? (Identifies unintentional open circuits).
    * Are there any nets with only one pin connection? (Could indicate a forgotten connection, unless it's an intentional test point or antenna connection).
    * Are power input pins connected to appropriate power nets?
    * Are ground pins connected to appropriate ground nets?
    * Are different power/ground domains (e.g., digital 3.3V, analog 3.3V, 5V, GND, AGND) correctly separated and/or connected via ferrite beads or other isolation methods if intended?
    * Are input pins correctly driven (not left floating unless specified as internal pull-up/down)?
    * Are output pins not directly shorted together (unless they are open-drain/collector with pull-ups)?

2.  **Component Selection and Usage:**
    * Does every component have a designated value or part number?
    * Are polarized components (electrolytic capacitors, diodes, ICs) shown with correct polarity/orientation?
    * Do component values seem appropriate for the circuit function (e.g., resistor values for pull-ups/downs, filter capacitors)?
    * Are components rated for the voltages and currents they will experience? (This is where datasheet comparison is vital).
    * Are required passive components (like series resistors, parallel resistors, filter capacitors) present on critical signal lines as per typical practice or datasheet recommendations?
    * Are component symbols correctly chosen to represent the intended physical part (especially pin mapping)?

3.  **Power Distribution & Decoupling:**
    * Are voltage regulator inputs and outputs correctly connected and bypassed with capacitors as per the datasheet recommendations?
    * Are decoupling capacitors present on the power pins of integrated circuits (especially digital logic, microcontrollers, and high-speed analog)?
    * Are the values and types of decoupling capacitors appropriate (e.g., smaller value ceramics for high-frequency decoupling close to pins, larger bulk capacitors on power rails)? (Datasheet recommendations are key here).
    * Is the power entry point protected (e.g., reverse polarity protection, input capacitance)?

4.  **Signal Integrity Considerations (Schematic Level):**
    * Are potential high-speed signal paths identifiable based on component types and net names?
    * Are recommended termination strategies shown for transmission lines (e.g., series resistors near drivers)? (Datasheet/application note comparison).
    * Are differential pairs correctly identified and wired?

5.  **Functional Blocks and Logic:**
    * Does the schematic clearly represent functional blocks?
    * Are the inputs and outputs between functional blocks correctly connected?
    * Are control signals correctly routed to the components they control?
    * Are unused pins on ICs handled according to datasheet recommendations (e.g., tied high, low, or left unconnected)?
    * Are necessary connectors, headers, and test points included?
    * Do connector pinouts match expected standards or mating parts?

6.  **Documentation and Readability:**
    * Is the schematic well-organized and easy to follow?
    * Are critical nets (power, ground, high-speed signals, control lines) clearly and consistently named?
    * Are there sufficient labels, notes, or comments to explain complex parts of the circuit?
    * Are hierarchical sheets (if used) logically structured and port connections clear?

This checklist provides a solid foundation for evaluating the schematic's correctness from an electrical design perspective.

Now, focusing *only* on getting the information needed to check these schematic points from the `.kicad_sch` file:

Given the types of schematic information required for this checklist (component designators, values/parts, footprints, pin numbers, net names, and the connections between pins and nets), what is the most suitable, information-dense format for extracting *only* this schematic data from KiCad for the LLM to consume?
